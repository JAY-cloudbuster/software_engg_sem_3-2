M5 — Multilingual Digital Marketplace and Decision-Support Platform for
Indian Farmers
This project focuses on creating a multilingual digital marketplace and decision-support ecosys
tem that enables Indian farmers to directly connect with institutional buyers, retailers, coop
eratives, and community procurement groups without excessive dependence on intermediaries.
The system must be carefully engineered to address real challenges faced by farmers, such as
limited access to transparent pricing, lack of negotiation power, unpredictable demand cycles,
and varying levels of digital literacy. Instead of functioning as a typical e-commerce listing
portal, the platform should offer rich decision-enabling capabilities—price comparison dash
boards, historical price visualizations, demand forecast models, quality-based price assessment,
and structured negotiation workflows. The interface must support native Indian languages
and multimodal interaction including voice-based navigation, icon-based user guidance, simple
visual metaphors, and SMS/IVR support where needed, recognizing that many stakeholders
operate in low-technology environments.
Technical depth may include AI-driven price prediction models, crop-based recommendation
systems, location-aware logistics planning, or analytics on market trends. Features such as
secure identity verification, auction or bidding models, dispute resolution processes, and trust
building mechanisms like structured ratings or verified seller profiles can enhance credibility
and adoption. The platform may further incorporate sustainability and financial empowerment

components such as subsidy awareness prompts, government scheme integration, crop advi
sory channels, or micro-financing partner interactions. The system should highlight thoughtful
engineering values—including inclusivity, fairness, security, and usability—and demonstrate
originality beyond superficial marketplace templates commonly published online.
